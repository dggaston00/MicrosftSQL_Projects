## **My SQL projects for ISAT B320 & ISAT B321**

### Project 6.1
In this project, I used Microsoft SQL to analyze student scholarship data within the CSCI and ISAT majors. I analyzed students based on their year in the program along with if they earned, lost, or kept the scholarship throughout their academic carrer. With this data, I was able to make an educated persuasive argument on why our CSCI and ISAT majors at USCB needed more funding.
